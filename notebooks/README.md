# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used throughout the coursework.

- `1_EDA_Preprocessing.ipynb` — Exploratory data analysis and preprocessing steps.
- `2_Baseline_Modeling.ipynb` — Implementation of baseline models such as Logistic Regression and SVM.
- `3_BERT_Model_1.ipynb` — Fine-tuning BERT for multi-label emotion classification.
