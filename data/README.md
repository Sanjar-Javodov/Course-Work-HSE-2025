The GoEmotions dataset consists of over 58,000 English Reddit comments labeled with 27 emotion categories plus a neutral label. 
Each sample can have multiple emotion labels (up to 5 simultaneously), and the data is somewhat imbalanced (about 30% of samples are neutral). These characteristics make the task challenging and are important to note in an academic context.
